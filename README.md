## Project Description
Project 2 utilizes a Spark application to process and analyze worldwide COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries from 2020-2021.
## Features
- Menu selection allows users to view a queried analysis
  - For example:
    - Confirmed cases within the first and last 4 months of our data
    - Recovery and mortality rates for top and bottom 10 countries
- Comparison sub-menu allows users to compare data between two distinct countries
- Creates a CSV file for each main analysis query
- Utilizes Tableau for data visualization
- Produces JAR for aggregating files
## Technologies Used
- Apache Spark
- Spark SQL
- YARN
- HDFS
- SBT
- Scala 2.12.10
- Tableau
## Future Development
- Analyze current Covid-19 data
- Select specific dates or groups of countries to compare and analyze
- Allow users to export a custom query to different file types
- Utilize Zeppelin to run directly within the application
## Getting Started 
- Clone the repository within your terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/AlexWhite252/project2`
- Run project in an IDE such as Intellij or Visual Studio Code
** Make sure you have all technologies installed and up-to-date
